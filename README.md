## How do I add my own images?
First place the `GorillaSigns.dll` into `BepInEx / plugins`.
Launch your game for the first time then a `GorillaSignsConfig` folder will show up next to your `GorillaSigns.dll`
Close your game then add any .png images you want into `GorillaSignsConfig/Images`.

## How to use ingame:

KeyBinds:
`Right Controller Primary Button / A`: This makes the sign larger.
`Right Controller Secondary Button / B`: This makes the sign smaller. 
`Left Controller Primary Button / X`: This allows you to drop the sign and place it where ever you like.
`Left Controller Scondary Button /Y`: This allows you to respawn/duplicate a sign.

`rightControllerPrimary2DAxis / Right Joystivk Pushed Right`: This allows you to cycle through the images forwards.
`rightControllerPrimary2DAxis / Right JoyStick Pushed Left`: This allows you to cycle through the images backwards.

Functions:
- add as many signs as you like.
- remove signs by picking them up and placing them in the bins (trash cans) located around the maps.
- save buttons are on the sides of the bins (trash cans).
- cyle through your own images!

Issues that may occur:
- Images on the saved signs may get swapped if you move the order of the images in the folder. 
- If you remove a image from the folder, all the saved sign images will change to the next in line and one will be blank.


- Currently GorillaSigns only supports .pngs, if you have any other file type you can use a free online converter! -
